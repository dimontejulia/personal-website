	    			<h1> Education</h1><br>
					<p class="lead">I started attending Queen's University in the September of 2015 after graduating from St. Clement's School in Toronto. I have loved my time in Kingston, Ontario for the past 3 years learning from inspiring professors, getting involved in campus life and making lifelong memories with friends.</p>
					<p class="lead">I am currently working on my Bachelor of Computing with Honours in Computer Science and am set to graduate in the spring of 2019. </p>

	    			<h1> Extracurriculars</h1>
					<p class="lead">I am very involved with campus activities at Queen's. I have worked at the campus coffee shop, Common Ground, as a cashier for the past two years and working with, and for other students. This past year, I was president for the Women in Computing organization helping to plan socials, organize outreach and informational events as well as promote the importance of women in technology.   </p>
					<p class="lead">Marketing has always been something I am interested in, serving as the marketing co-director for Soul Food (an organization that takes the leftover food from cafeterias and delivers it to shelters near by.) This upcoming year I am also the marketing director for QHacks, the second largest committe on campus for Queen's annual Hackathon. </p>

	    			<h1> Hobbies</h1>
					<p class="lead">Outside of school and campus life, I love to be active, especially by playing sports. Since first year, I have been competing on the Queen's tennis team. Additionally, I have participated on Queen's intramural sports teams such as volleyball and dodgeball.</p>
					<p class="lead">Being on exchange this semester, travelling has been one of my favourite hobbies. Visiting new countries, meeting new people and learning new cultures has been an amazing experience. </p>
